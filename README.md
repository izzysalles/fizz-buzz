## Introduction

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. This is a short project from a Elixir's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-e-phoenix-do-zero) :books:
 
 ## How it works
 
- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
